## Descripton
The project _“WearCast”_ is a __two-tier system__ designed to give the user suggestions for appropriate clothing based on current weather conditions. 

Using __sensors__ integrated with a __Wio Terminal__ the system is able to gather raw data of different weather parameters such as temperature and humidity. These sensors continuously gather data on the surrounding environment, which is processed and then transmitted to a __web-based user interface__ to be displayed as separate values. The system is also connected to a LED sensor that changes colors to red or blue to visually represent the temperature.

By analyzing and displaying these values, the user can access the weather data alongside tailored clothing suggestions and empowering messages. This ensures that the user is always well-prepared and fashionably attired for any weather scenario.
